# Etherium-Price-Prediction
In this project, Etherium (a decentralized, open-source blockchain) price is predicted using Pytorch LSTM. LSTM, long short-term memmory is an AI arcitecture used in neural networks. This network can process entire sequences of data instead of just single data points; and that is why its chosen for this prediction.
